# Tech-Blog

## Description
Tech-Blog is a website where and 'Tech-heads' can come discuss new things. The user is first greeted with any blog posts that have already been posted onto the website. If they look at the navbar they can see a link to login, and if they do not have an account yet they can instead sign-up and then login. Once logged in they will be taken to their own user dashboard, where they can view posts they have already created - and update said posts if they exist - or create new posts! Users can also comment on any post they see and offer input, or just their thoughts!
